# Tianas-Adventure-Down-The-Bayou
I created this game in my Java Programming class as a junior. My adventure game is based on the Disney movie, The Princess and the Frog. My code includes loops and nested loops, multiple classes, arrays, and random numbers. Players move through different worlds as they travel "down the bayou" with the goal of opening their own restaurant. Players must pick up and drop items, talk to other characters, and win mini-games to make it to the end. I enjoyed using multiple classes and sharing information between them. I coded my game in BlueJ.
